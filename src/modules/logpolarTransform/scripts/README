logpolarTransform.xml.template

This application demonstates the use of the logpolarTransform module. 
 
The application computes the forward Cartesian-to-log-polar transform 
and then performs the inverse log-polar-to-Cartesian transform.  
The transform  is performed on images read from /icub/cam/left so ensure that this
port exists and is streaming images.

Edit the xml.template file to suit your own platform.  The only change that should be 
necessary is to replace the node name (icub1 in the template).

Note that the application launches two instatiations of logpolarTransform.
The first, implementing the forward transform, uses the default parameters.
However, the second, implementing the inverse transform, needs to rename
the module in order to avoid port name conflicts.  Since both modules 
read the same configuration file, logpolarTransform.ini, in /conf,
the second module also has a command-line parameter to specify the 
(inverse) direction of the transform (the default value is the forward direction).

Please refer to the logpolarTransform module documentation for details on the
various module parameters:
