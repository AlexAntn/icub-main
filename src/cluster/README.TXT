The yarprun script can help start and stop processes remotely.
Run "./yarprun" for more information.

It depends entirely on you having ssh working well using
public key authentication.

The directory containing yarprun should be available in a "cluster"
subdirectory of each home directory.  To change this, modify
the "BASE_PATH" in the yarprun script.
