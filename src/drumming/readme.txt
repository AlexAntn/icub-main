iCub_drum is the simulated drummer working on WEBOTS simulator. The simulated drumming controller was 
implemented by EPFL, and the audioAnalyser module which takes the played patterns via microphones and 
supplies the number of beats to the the simulated drummer was implemented by HERTS. These modules were
integrated in summer school 2007.

After starting the Webots simulator, start demo and demo1 scripts under the debug folder to start the 
audio and drumming modules. When there is an instruction in the screen saying HUMAN PLAYING please play 
a rhythm and wait for the simulated drummer to imitate it.
