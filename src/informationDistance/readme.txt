When sending data to the ComputeDistance module, put the sensor values to  a messaging bottle, at every time step.
Put integer  1 to the zeroth element of every message bottle, and put the sensor values into the bottle starting 
from index 1. Put 0 to the zeroth element to indicate that the sequence of data items is finished.
