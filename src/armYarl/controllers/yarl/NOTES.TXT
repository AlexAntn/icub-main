=============================

This module seems to depend on "KDL", the orocos kinematics and 
dynamics library.

Downloaded this from:

Built via CMake.  Turned out to depend in turn on 
  boost/graph/adjacency_list.hpp
Installed this using package libboost-graph-dev on debian.

Placed build location in environment variable "KDL_DIR".

Built module via CMake.
