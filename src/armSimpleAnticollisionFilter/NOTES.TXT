No longer updated. 

Right now, roboop is integrated. (Should be moved to some contrib directory, 
or simply installed locally by the people who want to use this module)

paulfitz's installation notes (unofficial, there may be better ways)
=============================

This module depends on the "roboop" library.

This was downloaded from:
  http://www.cours.polymtl.ca/roboop/

It was built using cmake.

The location of the unpacked directory was placed in the environment 
variable "ROBOOP_DIR".

A link to "$ROBOOP_DIR/source" was made at "$ROBOOP_DIR/roboop" to
match the modules expectations about names of header files.

The current module then successfully built with cmake.
