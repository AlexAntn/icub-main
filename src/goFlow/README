goFlow - "go with the Flow"
---------------------------
Developer: Chris McCarthy (Australian National University)
Current Status:  Not yet ready for use (or working correctly). 

"goFlow" is intended to be a multi-purpose optical flow engine, to support a 
wide range of tasks using optical flow.  The intention is to provide easy to
use "one call does all" functions, as well as a more flexible interface
allowing modifations to the choice of flow method, pre-filters and other
parameters.

First priority is to implement Lucas-Kanade and Horn-Schunck.  Access to the
openCV functions will also be included.
 
Please note that "goFlow" is still under development and not yet ready for use.
