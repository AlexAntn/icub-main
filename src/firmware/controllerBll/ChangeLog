	* Started ChangeLog, please report here a brief summary 
	of changes made to the firmware. Keep track of the build
	number, and if possible add a list of the files you 
	modified.
	* Current build 1.
2008-03-March  Francesco Nori  <iron@liralab.t>
	* The coupling in version 153 has been slightly changed. 
	Hopefully this will fix a problem with positioning the shoulder.
	* Current build 5.
2008-26-March  Serena Ivaldi  <serena.ivaldi@iit.t>
	* New velocity and acceleration estimation: discrete time fixed windowing.
	* Current build 6.
2008-23-July  Francesco Nori  <francesco.nori@iit.t>
	* New check_in_position now return true when the trajectory generation
	is ended.
	* Current build 14.
2008-23-July  Francesco Nori  <francesco.nori@iit.t>
	* New led code:
		- led0_on  = pwm0 on
		- led0_off = pwm0 off
		- led2_on  = pwm1 on
		- led2_off = pwm2 off
		- led3     = on while waiting the remaining time of 1ms
		- led1_on  = cab bus off 
	* Current build 15.
2008-23-August  Francesco Nori  <francesco.nori@iit.t>

	* Current build 17.	
2008-20-October  Francesco Nori  <francesco.nori@iit.t>
	* Minor change for version 0x0154.

2009-10-March  Maggiali Marco <marco.maggiali@iit.t>
	* fixed bug in the i2t
	* added 0x0155 for brake_setup and future features	 
	* Current build 24.
2009-19-March  Maggiali Marco <marco.maggiali@iit.t>
	* MIN_DUTY at 8. It was 14, but it was too high and the motor tend to move . 
	* Current build 25.	
2009-25-March  Maggiali Marco <marco.maggiali@iit.t>
	* Added control for the receiving of the PID values before enabling the PWM.
    * Current build 26.
	
2009-25-March  Maggiali Marco <marco.maggiali@iit.t>
	* PWM MIN_DUTY is 6. A motor in the legs joint 2 was still moving a little bit in a certain position.
	* The PWM STEP is 10. The motor response is faster then before. There will be an increment of this value after more accurate tests.
    * Current build 27.
2009-xx-xx  Maggiali Marco <marco.maggiali@iit.t>
	* Missing
      * Current build 28.
	
2009-21-May  Francesco Nori <iron@liralab.it>
	* Version 0x0152 bug fixed.
	* Now PWM is coupled after its computation.     
	* Current build 29.
	
2009-31-July  Marco Randazzo <marco.randazzo@iit.it>
	* Fixed GetControlMode message on 2BLL / 4DC.

2009-20-October  Marco Maggiali <marco.maggiali@iit.it>
	* Added MODE_OPENLOOP =0x50. TO BE TESTED 
	* Current build 31.	

2009-13-December  iron <francesco.nori@iit.it>
	* Version 0x0153 now decouples also the duty cycles. 
	* Includes a tentative for fixing a possible delay (4ms)
	on the trasmission of positions in version 0x0153 and 0x0173.
	* Current build 32.	
	
2009-28-December  Marco Maggiali <marco.maggiali@iit.it>

	* Current build 33.

2010-11-January  Francesco Nori <iron@liralab.it>
	* Added "if" conditions: do not update position if abs_encoder fails.
	* Checks timeout on the presence of coupled information. 
	* Current build 34.

2010-11-January  Francesco Nori and Randaz <iron@liralab.it>
	* Stops sending both encoders if one fails (avoid troubles with coupled boards)
	* Current build 35.

2010-20-April  Francesco Nori <iron@liralab.it>
	* Stops controlling (disable PWM) if velocity messages 
	* are not received in 400ms (VELOCITY_TIMEOUT).
	* Current build 36.

2010-29-April  Francesco Nori <iron@liralab.it>
	* _vel_timeout is now passed via CAN
	* Current build 37.

2010-11-May  Francesco Nori <iron@liralab.it>
	* _vel_timeout is now passed via CAN on a separate message
	* Current build 38.	
	
2010-3-June  Marco Randazzo <marco.randazzo@iit.it>
	* Merging firmware version 1.73/1.74 in standard firmware in order to provide MODE_TORQUE control mode to all firmware versions.
	* CAN masks changed. Now all firmware versions can read force data.
	* compute_pwm function changed. All firmware versions can now enter MODE_TORQUE control mode.
	* four force watchdogs are now used to check if force data from board 11/12/13/14 are recevied.
	  boards 11/12 can be virtual (forces calculated by iDyn and transmitted on CAN bus by PC104)  
	* Current build 39.	

2010-28-June  Francesco Nori <iron@liralab.it>
	* Bug fixed on the shoulder coupling
	* Current build 40.	

2010-06-July  Marco Randazzo <marco.randazzo@iit.it>
	* Added various CAN mesages to set the impedance of a joint
	* Impedance velocity mode separated by Impedance Position Mode
	* Current build 41.	

2010-26-July  Marco Randazzo <marco.randazzo@iit.it>
	* New decoupling matrix for torque control
 	* IMPORTANT: in function can_send_broadcast() now PWM is transmitted BEFORE the decoupling.
 	             function decouple_dutycycle_new_joint() expects transmitted torques at the joint level (before decoupling),
		     while the old function decouple_dutycycle() expects torques at motor level (after decoupling) 
		     you can change this behavior by setting/unsetting the macro USE_NEW_DECOUPLING in decoupling.h 
	* Current build 43
	
2010-02-Aug  Marco Randazzo <marco.randazzo@iit.it>
    * receiving a calibration command (_calibrated[i]==true) is now mandatory in order to turn PWM ON
	* Current build 44

2010-19-Aug  Marco Randazzo <marco.randazzo@iit.it>
	* torque error is now broadcasted separetly by position error.
	* A new broadcast message, CAN_BCAST_PID_ERROR, is introduced, that contains position error and torque error.
	* CAN_BCAST_CURRENT now contains only the current information, not the pid error.
	* Current build 46
