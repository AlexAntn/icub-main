You can try this to see if it works:

./reaching_module --structure conf/icub_right_arm4_struct.xml


on another terminal 

./simulator conf/icub_right_arm4_shape.xml conf/icub_right_arm4_shape.xml 


and then manually connect the ports:


'/vc_command/out'to '/simulator/angles/in'
'target/in' to '/simulator/target/in'


If you want to test if the oritentation is working properly, use

./reaching_module --structure conf/icub_right_arm4_struct.xml --orientation 1

instead.
