These examples are hidden here *on purpose*. We should not in any way
give the impression that this is the proper way to use the 
learningMachine functionality. There are learningMachine modules for 
a reason and they should be used.

Ugo Pattacini: the comment above outlines the position of the author
of this framework, however there exist of course cases where the resort
to the library and not to the modules corresponds to a definetely better
software design. Therefore, despite the fact that the modules available
under main/src/modules/learningMachine should cover the majority of the
user's needs, please judge with care.

Example of case where the use of the library in lieu of the modules is
commendable: the development of an own library that encorporates the
learningMachine functionality so that the final product is self-contained
and thus it is not required to launch the learning modules externally.
