*** work in progress - not intended for use as yet ***

Predicts impact point about a single camera from the optical flow.

Currently runs with no command line options.  Just run ./impactMap, and
connect the impactMap/imageIn port to the framegrabber.

Video output can be read from impactMap/imageOut.

Options and documentation to come.
