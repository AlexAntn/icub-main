This module uses source code from the EDISON system, Rutgers University:
http://www.caip.rutgers.edu/riul/research/code/EDISON/

Used files are a selection of:
edison_source/edge 
edison_src/segm
edison_source/parser

Requires a powerfull computer...

I had to change function GetRegions in msImageProcessor.cpp

TODO: edisonLib - the above files could be wrapper around a static lib
