rectification.xml.template

This application demonstates the use of the rectification module
to rectify two images generated by two verging cameras to remove the 
epipolar distortion. 

The approach is a direct implementation of the paper by Dankers et al. 2004, 
which in turn is based on an adaptation of a technique described in 
Fusiello et al. 2000.

In addition to rectifying the images as detailed in Dankers et al 2004, 
we also shift the right image with respect to the left image to compensate 
for differences in the positions of the principal points in the left and 
right images.

Please refer to the logPolar module documentation for details on the
various module parameters:

Edit the xml.template file to suit your own platform.  The only change that should be 
necessary is to replace the node name (icub1 in the template). 
You should also make sure that the port dependencies are satisfied.

Note that the application has three port dependencies:

/icub/cam/left 
/icub/cam/right 
/icub/head/state:o 

The first two stream images from the iCub cameras.
The third is used stream the state of the encoders and is used by the module to 
extract the extrinsic parameters of the cameras and, specificially, to compute 
the vergence of the cameras.
