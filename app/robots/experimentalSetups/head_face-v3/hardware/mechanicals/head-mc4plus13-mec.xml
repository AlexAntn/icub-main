<!--
    NOTE: (m.a.) 
    on 23jul15 i revised and formatted the file and aligned it as much as i could with values from grenoble (see file icub_head.xml). 
    - i must review ... maybe nothing
    - in Encoder i used 182.044 because we have an AEA and 284.444 because .... we have an INC-ENC with 4x512x50 = 102400, where 4 is given by hal which samples 4 time 
      each line of the encoder, 512 are the lines per revolution, and 50 is a motor reduction. then we have 102400/360 = 284.444. then i kept the same sign (+, +) as in grenoble.
    
    on 22jul15 i worked on calib of eyes-tilt with degrees. i have changed the Zeros from 0 to 180 because ... grenoble file had it and i forgot
    and ... also joint 0 neck-yaw must have it.
