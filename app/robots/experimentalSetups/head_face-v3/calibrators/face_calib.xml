    NOTE: (m.a.) 
    on 22jul15 i revised and formatted the file and aligned it as much as i could with values from grenoble. 
    - on maxPwm field for j0 and j1 there was 500. now there is 0 as in grenoble. is it used?  
    - values 666 and 999 mean that the value is not used.
    - i must review the calib parameters
    
    on 22jul15 i tested the calib parameters for calib type4 (it is type 5 actually). it seems that calib4 must be 0. i was expecting that
    it would have been the value of the hw limit. in previous tests it was like that. however now there is something changed, for instance the TOBEFOUNDWHAT
    which moves the readings of an offset. .... find out the rule.
    as a matter of fact, the param calibration3 is found by trial and error.
    i havent changed yet the value in joint 3 lip-high because it is not bound to a hw limit. must wait the cover is mounted.
    
    on 22jul15 i also tested the calib parameters for calib type3. i worked on joint 1 eyelids. i have computed the value 19000 with trial and error.  
    i should also use the xml file but some changes are required in its formulas. for instance the conversion factor is to be changed into 182.044 etc... 
    in file xml the formulas are:
    val is reading of encoder
    valdeg = val / 182.044
    x = (abs(valdeg) - abs(Zero)), if(x>=0) { calib3 = x*182.044 } else { calib3 = (360+x)*182.044 }
    by this procedure we read val = 51868, hence valdeg = 285 deg, hence ... param3 = 19100
