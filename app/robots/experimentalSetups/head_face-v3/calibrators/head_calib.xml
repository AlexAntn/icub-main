<!--
    NOTE: (m.a.) 
    on 23jul15 i revised and formatted the file and aligned it as much as i could with values from grenoble. 
    - on maxPwm field for j0 and j1 there was 500. now there is 0 as in grenoble. is it used?  
    - values 666 and 999 mean that the value is not used.
    - i must review the calib parameters
    
    
    the value 54431 is obtained from the xml file with some changes ...
    when i did it again by positioning the joint roughly at zero pos, i have obtained 53011 ... which is about the same value.
    
    on 22jul15 i also tested the calib parameters for calib type3. i worked on joint 3 eyes-tilt. i used the xml file but some changes are required in 
    its formulas. for instance the conversion factor is to be changed into 182.044 etc...    

    on 30jul15: the value 8191 (45 deg in icubdegrees) for eyes is used to tell the calibrator that the hw limit is at 45 deg.
    it is a value given by the mechanics.
