This directory contains robot-specific files. Depending on the value of the ICUB_ROBOTNAME
environment variable cmake will determine the name of the robot you use and generate code
to install the correct directory to ICUB_ROOT/app from which files  will be picked up at runtime
(mostly by iCubInterface but also from other modules).

If the ICUB_ROBOTNAME variable does not exist nothing will be installed.
