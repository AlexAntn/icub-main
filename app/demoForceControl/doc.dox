A module for interacting with the robot. 

\section intro_sec Description

The zeroForce application opens one module for each limb, achieving active compliance (impedance or zero force) using a 6-axis F/T sensor.

Each module control one limb. When connected, the offset of the sensor is cancelled. If the module is in modality "zfc", if moved from the starting position, 
the limb drifts. If the module is in modality "imp", the limb behave like a spring around that position.

The modality can be changed by writing on the shell:
- set imp (for impedance control)
- set zfc (for zero force control)

\section dep_sec Dependencies
The modules depends on iDyn and iKin.

\section parameters_sec Parameters

The parameters which are required to the module are:
- context: no default context is set
- from: no default config file is set.

\section config_sec Configuration Files

Configuration files are located in the ICUB_DIR/app/demoForceControl/conf folder. 

The files of type partLimbFT.ini (i.e. leftArmFT.ini) contain the information about the different limbs: robot, part, initPosition, joint limits, and others. 



\section example_sec How to run the application



To run the application, please do the following :

- manager.py $ICUB_DIR/app/demoForceControl/scripts/zdemoForceControl.xml
