Hello, my name is iCub. 
I was born five years ago thanks to the work of many European researchers.
I guess some of them are with you today. 

I live in Genoa and I have family members in a number of labs across the world, where I’m an experimental platform, and these are my friends (he shows a group portrait of his lab).
I like being around people, and I would love to be of more help to them. 
But like most machines of my generation, I can't.  

You see, we have always thought we might become smarter than you, or at least smarter than them (and we see a dog around). We are quite good at carrying out specific tasks. Indeed, many of us are extremely useful. However, unlike you – and them (again he hints at the dog) – we’re lost at the minimal variation, and we’re not good at interacting with our environment. Especially a human environment. The problem is you have to adapt to us, rather than the other way around.

Now, the RoboCom consortium are going to try something completely different. Something that will let us adapt to you. 
We want future systems to become your “companions” and take on tasks that no human should be performing, like dangerous or heavy jobs. We might help you do what any human should or could be performing, like living an independent life. Just think of elderly people, or people with disabilities. One day we may even help in a nuclear crisis, like the one unfolding today in Fukushima. 

Indeed, in a way I’m one of the last of the old machines. Because even today’s most advanced robot is not capable of what the RoboCom consortium wants to achieve. You know what? We are all really excited to see what machines will look like in the future, and what they will be able to do. And today we would like to share this excitement with you.
