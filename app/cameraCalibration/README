cameraCalibrationLeft.xml.template
cameraCalibrationRight.xml.template

This application demonstates the use of the camCalibConf module to calibrate
the left and right cameras of the iCub head and writes the intrinsic camera
parameters to a single calibration file icubEyes.ini
 
Both applications should be run to calibrate the cameras.  The Left version
writes that intrinsic camera parameters to a specific Group in the configuration file.
The Group name is specified as a command line parameter: 
CAMERA_CALIBRATION_CONFIGURATION_LEFT

Similarly, The Right version writes that intrinsic camera parameters to a 
specific Group in the configuration file. The Group name is also specified 
as a command line parameter: CAMERA_CALIBRATION_CONFIGURATION_RIGHT

Any existing instrinsic camera parameters in either of these two groups in 
icubEyes.ini are overwritten by the calibration process.  Make a backup if you are 
unsure of the calibration procedure.

Edit the xml.template files to suit your own platform.  You will need to change at least
the node name (icub1 in the template).  You may also want to change Group names
depending on the applications and modules with which you will use the resultant
configuration file. 

You should also make sure that the port dependencies are satisfied.
Note that the application has two port dependencies:

/icub/cam/left 
/icub/cam/right 

which stream images from the iCub cameras.

For convenience, a chessboard calibration image is provided in the 
$ICUB_ROOT/app/cameraCalibration/data directory. This calibration image matches
the calibration pattern parameters in the icubEyes.ini configuration file.
