imageSource.xml.template

This application demonstates the use of the imageSource module which 
streams an image from a file to a port. This allows the application to be run 
without having to be physically connected to the iCub cameras.  Random noise is 
added to each image to differentiate between frames. In this application, 
the imageSource module streams the images to /icub/cam/left so that you can adapt the 
application to read from the cameras simply by removing the imageSource module.
The image file is provided in the $ICUB_ROOT/app/imageSource/conf directory
along with the imageSource.ini configuration file.

Please refer to the imageSource module documentation for further details on the 
module parameters: http://eris.liralab.it/iCub/dox/html/group__icub__imageSource.html

Edit the xml.template file to suit your own platform.  The only change that should be 
necessary is to replace the node name (icub1 in the template).
