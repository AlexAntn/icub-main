logPolarTransform.xml.template

This application demonstates the use of the logPolarTransform module. 
 
The application computes the forward Cartesian-to-log-polar transform 
and then performs the inverse log-polar-to-Cartesian transform.  
Please refer to the logPolar module documentation for details on the
various module parameters:
http://eris.liralab.it/iCub/dox/html/group__icub__logPolarTransform.html

Edit the xml.template file to suit your own platform.  The only change that should be 
necessary is to replace the node name (icub1 in the template).

The application uses the imageSource module to stream an image from a file to 
provide the image data. This allows the application to be run without 
having to be physically connected to the iCub cameras.  Random noise is 
added to each image to differentiate between frames.  The imageSource
module streams the images to /icub/cam/left so that you can adapt the 
template to read from the cameras simply by removing the imageSource module.
The image file is provided in the $ICUB_ROOT/app/logPolarTransform/conf directory
along with the imageSource.ini configuration file.

Note that the application launches two instatiations of logPolarTransform.
The first, implementing the forward transform, uses the default parameters.
However, the second, implementing the inverse transform, needs to rename
the module in order to avoid port name conflicts.  Since both modules 
read the same configuration file, logPolarTransform.ini, in /conf,
the second module also has a command-line parameter to specify the 
(inverse) direction of the transform (the default value is the forward direction).
