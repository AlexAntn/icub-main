Note to developers:

For those of you developing in this repository, we'd like to ask you
one favor: please keep the global iCub project compilable by "newbies"
at all times.  In other words, if someone checks out iCub CVS, runs
cmake, and then compiles, everything should work okay.

What you can do without worrying:

+ Do anything you like for modules not listed in
$ICUB_DIR/src/CMakeLists.txt.  For example, feel free to place new
modules in $ICUB_DIR/src that aren't yet well tested, are currently
broken, came to you in a deranged dream, etc.

What we'd ask you to do to be polite to newcomers:

+ Don't add a module to the list in $ICUB_DIR/src/CMakeLists.txt until
you know it compiles on machines other than your own.  Check both
Windows and Linux.  If you don't have experience with Linux, you can
(at the time of writing anyway) just check that the module shows up
"green" on the compile status report:

  http://eris.liralab.it/iCub/dox/report/

+ If you're not certain a module will compile, but would still like
the convenience of having it in the global project, consider using the
"ICUB_TEST" conditional variable (see its use in
$ICUB_DIR/src/CMakeLists.txt), or add your own.

Thanks for your understanding.
